# Dylan Green - RIT Software Engineering Student
An open letter to recruiters considering hiring Dylan Green, a student from RIT

A student from RIT named Dylan Green is searching for a job, possibly with the United States government.

He is a known participant in the far right in New York. He is active on Gab, and on his personal Gab profile he has posted content praising the Taliban, saying that Jews are taking over tech companies, and saying that he will misgender trans people because “it’s the right thing to do” in his words.

I’d highly caution any government agency or private business from hiring Dylan. He has recently tried to bury all of this so that recruiters would not see it but I cannot in good conscience allow this individual to get away with the harassment/discrimination/hateful ideals that he seems to live by.

I would also add that he was recently removed from his position in the RIT church due to hate speech against other students.

Here is a selection of things that were either posted or re-posted by Dylan Green on Gab which he has tried to hide specifically because he doesn’t want recruiters seeing it:

- REPOSTED: "The Taliban is going to ban abortion, vaccines, and gay marriage... maybe we were fighting on the wrong side for 20 years"

- "Despite their evil cause, and their religion being not mine, the Taliban did something based: It banned abortion and euthanasia [...] It just makes you question just what the Americans were fighting for, when we can't even get THAT issue right."

- "I might be deactivating this account for some time. Seeing as I might be about to receive a government job, this account existing could compromise a lot during that time."

- REPOSTED: "It's really funny to me how it's so "taboo" to point out how Marxist Jews are working hand in hand with the Democrat Party and Big Tech [...]"

- "It's August and companies are still in 100% homo pride mode"

If you are an investigator for government recruitment I would urge you to investigate Dylan more, it is my opinion that hiring individuals like this to positions of public trust represents a clear and present danger to our democracy.
